     <p>We can't deny the fact that exams do cause a lot of stress to students, no matter whether you are appearing for board exams or entrance exams college,university,even interviews. However, instead of lamenting over it being stressful, there does exist a way out and a solution to ace exams without much effort.</p>
     <p> Solving previous year's papers and sample questions are a good step that aids in reducing stress to a great extent. It also helps in decreasing exhaustion and making students ready for facing even the toughest tests.</p>
